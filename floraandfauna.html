     <h1>Flora and Fauna</h1>
     <h2>What is flora and fauna?</h2>
     <p>In a nutshell, the term flora relates to all plant life and the term fauna represents all animal life. Let us dive deeper into these terms, exploring their origins and etymologies.</p>
     <br>
     <h2>Flora</h2>
     <p>The term flora in Latin means “Goddess of the Flower.” Flora is a collective term for a group of plant life found in a particular region. The whole plant kingdom is represented by this name.
      Flora is classified and differentiated based on many factors. The best one among them is the area in which they grow or are found. Some grow in desert regions or in water, some are found in hilly areas while some are endemic to a specific geographic location.
      According to the place at which they grow, they have adaptations also. For example, Cactus plants are naturally seen in deserts. They have adaptations like modified leaves or prickles to preserve water and protect themselves from predators.
      The agricultural flora consists of plants cultivated by men for their use. Horticulture is the practice of growing ornamental and decorative flowers, which are also known as garden flora.</p>

      <h2>Fauna</h2>
      <p>Fauna represents the animal life indigenous to a region. There are many explanations regarding the origin of the word. As per Roman mythology, Fauna or “Faunus” is the name of the goddess of fertility. Another source is “Fauns” which means “Forest spirits.“</p>

       <p> Animal kingdom comprises a variety of animal life forms. Hence, the classification of fauna is much more complex than the floral division. Therefore, for ease of classification;</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Birds are categorized under the name Avifauna.</li>
        <li>Fishes under Pisci Fauna</li>
        <li>Microorganisms including bacteria and virus are generally considered under animal kingdom, they are known as Microfauna.</li>
        <li>All unknown and undiscovered animals are named as cryptofauna.</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="https://manipurtourism.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/flora.jpg" alt="" class="fauna">
        <p>Since time immemorial, there have been accounts of animals that have been thought to exist but have eluded the scientific community, thereby classifying them as cryptofauna or cryptids.</p>

          <p>Most of these reports are just tall tales but until recently, a few have documented through actual physical evidence and scientific scrutiny. One such example is the colossal squid. This cryptid has been allegedly been sighted since the 17th and 18th century, often being cited in the diaries and logbooks of sailors.</p>
          
         <p>It wasn’t until the 21st century when conclusive proof was found in the form of a live specimen being entangled in a fishing net. It was taken in and studied by scientists who concluded that it was a new species of squid. Since then, there has been undisputed confirmation about the existence of giant squids.</p>
          
         <p> The earth is beautiful because of all these life forms. Other life forms depend on them for various resources and exploit them.</p>
          
         <p> Conservation of flora and fauna is thus necessary for future survival. Biosphere reserves, national parks, zoos and sanctuaries are a few instances of the measures taken by the government for conservation of flora and fauna. Another example is the Tiger project launched by the Government of India with the goal of saving the tigers in the country from extinction</p>
       <h2>Importance of Flora and Fauna</h2>
       <p>The flora and fauna are important for the following reasons:</p>
       <h3>Maintains Ecological Balance</h3>
       <p>Flora and fauna are very important for human existence. The flora liberates oxygen that is consumed by the fauna for respiratory activities. Fauna, in turn, liberates carbon dioxide consumed by the flora for photosynthesis.</p>

        <p>Flora and fauna hugely benefit mankind through its medicinal and food offerings. Animals maintain the equilibrium by predating on different plants and animals to balance their population on earth.</p>
        
        <p>Animal droppings are a source of fertilizer. The dead animals decay and act as supplement minerals for other animals.</p>
      <h3>Aesthetic Value</h3>
      <p>The flora and fauna spread across the earth contribute to the aesthetic value of the earth. People visit several biosphere reserves, national parks and zoos, forests, botanical gardens, etc to enjoy the beauty of landmarks. This explains the significance of flora and fauna in our day to day lives.</p>
      <h3>Expansion of Local Economies</h3>
      <p>Flora and Fauna contribute to the local economies through tourism. The flora and fauna of Amazon forests attract tourists and scientists which contributes to about 50 million dollars to the Brazilian economy.</p>

       <p> Caribbean, Indonesia, Panama are other tourist locations that attract millions of people due to its widespread flora and fauna.</p>
       <br>
      <h2>Flora and Fauna of India</h2>
      <p>The flora and fauna in India are diverse with a variety of plants and animal varieties. The popular fauna of India includes 500 different varieties of mammals, 2000 species of birds, 30.000 types of insects and several varieties of fish, amphibians and reptiles. Elephants, Royal Bengal Tiger, rhinos, bison, lions are some common fauna found in the country.</p> 
      <img src="https://static.kopykitab.com/image/cache/data/abhijeet/ai1022-300x380.jpg" alt="" class="floraandfaunaofindia">
       <p>India also contains a variety of flora that includes the Alpines, temperate forests, deciduous forests, evergreen forests, oaks, rhododendrons, pine, spruce, deodar, laurels, maples, bamboos and tall grasses.</p>
        <h2>Threats to Flora and Fauna</h2>
        <h3>Habitat Loss</h3>
        Habitat loss includes habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation. Habitat destruction occurs when the physical environment required by a species is altered so
        that the species can no longer live there. Human destruction of habitats accelerated in the latter half of the twentieth century. For example, half of Sumatra's
        forests, a biodiversity hotspot, is now gone. The neighboring island of Borneo has lost a similar area of forest, and forest loss continues in protected areas of
        Borneo. The forests are removed for timber and to plant palm oil plantations. Palm oil is used in many products including food products, cosmetics,
        and biodiesel in Europe. According to Global Forest Watch, 9.7% of tree cover was lost globally from 2002 to 2019, and 9% of that occurred in Indonesia and
        Malaysia (where Sumatra and Borneo are located). </p>

        <h3>Overexploitation</h3>
        Overexploitation (overharvesting) involves hunting, fishing, or otherwise collecting organisms at a faster rate than they can be replenished. While overfishing and
        poaching are common examples of overexploitation, some fungi and slow-growing plant species are also overexploited. For example, stocks of wild ginseng, which
        is valued for its health benefits, are dwindling. Peyote cactus, which causes hallucinations and is used in sacred ceremonies, is also declining. Yarsagumba, dead
        moth larvae that were infected by fungal parasites (caterpillar fungus, Ophiocordyceps sinensis), is overexploited because it is highly valued in traditional medicine
       and used as an aphrodisiac.</p>
       <img src="https://ecojungle.net/post/consequences-of-overexploitation-of-natural-resources/logging-is-the-main-cause-of-forest-degradation.webp" alt="" class="overexploitation">
       <h3>Pollution</h3>
       <p>Pollution occurs when chemicals, particles, or other materials are released into the environment, harming the organisms there. Pollution has contributed to the
        decline of many threatened species. For example, a 2007 study by Kingsford and colleagues found that pollution was a major pressure on 30% of threatened
        species in Australia and surrounding regions.
       </p>
       <p>Power plants, factories, and vehicles are common sources of air pollution. In some cases, the pollutants are directly toxic (for example, lead), but in other cases the
        pollutants indirectly cause ecological harm when they are present in unnaturally large quantities (for example, carbon dioxide emissions leading to climate change).
        Not only can air pollutants directly harm animals by causing respiratory issues and cancer as well as damage vegetation, but some interact with the atmosphere to
        form acid deposition (commonly called acid rain). Acid deposition which disrupts aquatic ecosystems as well as soil communities and plant growth.
        </p>
        <img src="https://domf5oio6qrcr.cloudfront.net/medialibrary/10245/GettyImages-1098018152.jpg" alt="" class="pollution">
        <p>Heavy metals, plastics, pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, and sediments are examples of water pollution. Heavy metals (including copper, lead, mercury, and zinc)
          can leach into soil and water from mines. Nutrients, such as nitrate and phosphates, are healthy in bodies of water to an extent, but when fertilizer pollution adds
          too many of these nutrients at one time, algal blooms can result. This has cascading effects that can ultimately shade and kill aquatic plants and deplete oxygen
          needed by fish and other animals. A particularly concerning water pollution problem is micropollutants. For examples, some
          chemical residues affect growth, cause birth defects, and have other toxic effects on humans and other organisms even at very low concentrations.
        </p>
        <h3>Invasive Species</h3>
        <p>Invasive species are non-native organisms that, when introduced to an area out of its native range, disrupt the community they invade. Non-native (exotic)
          refers to species occurring outside of their historic distribution. Invasive species are have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans into an
          ecosystem in which they did not evolve. Human transportation of people and goods, including the intentional transport of organisms for trade, has dramatically
          increased the introduction of species into new ecosystems. These new introductions are sometimes at distances that are well beyond the capacity of the species to
          ever travel itself and outside the range of the species’ natural predators. Invasive species can cause ecological and economic damage.
        </p>
        <p>Invasive plants like the purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) and kudzu (Pueraria montana) threaten native plants through competition for resources, and they
          drastically altered the ecosystems they invaded. They indirectly harms the animals that depend on native plants to be primary producers and to
          provide habitat. Some invasive plants, like yellow flag iris (Iris pseudacorus) are toxic, directly poisoning the livestock and wildlife that eat them. The awns
          projecting from cheat grass (Bromus tectorum) during seed dispersal irritate and injure cattle. Invasive insects and plant pathogens harm crops and
          native species. The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis ) has killed millions of ash trees in the eastern and midwestern United States and Canada. In spreads
          through movement of firewood and other wood products. Xylella fastidiosa fastidiosa is an invasive bacterium that is native to Central America that causes several
          diseases including Pierce's disease of grapes in California and the southeastern United States. It is spread through an invasive insect, the glassy-
          winged sharpshooter.
        </p>
        <p>One reason why invasive species proliferate dramatically outside of their native range is due to release from predators. This means that parasites, predators, or
          herbivores that usually regulate their populations are not present, allowing them to outcompete or otherwise decimate native species, which are still regulated.
          Based on this principle, organisms that regulate the invasive species populations have been introduced the newly colonized areas in some cases. The release of
          organisms (or viruses) to limit population size is called biological control. As described the examples below, biological control of invasive species has had varying
          success, exacerbating the problem in some cases and solving it in others.
        </p>
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRAt5ooncj_lO0RxrBT8fZpn9gVjctYLyZwxPskq10WCygRLSiArcrBIYq18HXSo_jqtNA&usqp=CAU" alt="" class="invasivespecies">
        <p>Introduced into Australia, this cactus soon spread over millions of hectares of range land driving out forage plants. In 1924, the cactus moth, Cactoblastis cactorum,
          was introduced (from Argentina) into Australia. The caterpillars of the moth are voracious feeders on prickly-pear cactus, and within a few years, the caterpillars had
          reclaimed the range land without harming a single native species. However, its introduction into the Caribbean in 1957 did not produce such happy results. By 1989,
          the cactus moth had reached Florida, and now threatens five species of native cacti there.
        </p>
        <p>In 1946 two species of Chrysolina beetles were introduced into California to control the Klamath weed (St. Johnswort, Hypericum perforatum) that was ruining
          millions of acres of range land in California and the Pacific Northwest. Before their release, the beetles were carefully tested to make certain that they would not
          turn to valuable plants once they had eaten all the Klamath weed they could find. The beetles succeeded beautifully, restoring about 99% of the endangered range
          land and earning them a commemorative plaque at the Agricultural Center Building in Eureka, California.
      </p>
      <p>To summarize the lessons learned from biological control successes and failures, only candidates that have a very narrow target preference (eat only a sharply-
        limited range of hosts) should be chosen. Each candidate should be carefully tested to be sure that once it has cleaned up the intended target, it does not turn to
        desirable species. Biological controls must not be used against native species. Finally, introduction of non-native species into the environment should be avoided
        because they could themselves be invasive.
      </p>
      <h3>Climate Change</h3>
      <p>Global climate change is also a consequence of human population needs for energy, and the use of fossil fuels to meet those needs. Essentially, burning fossil fuels, including as oil, natural gas, and coal, increases carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere (see Nutrient Cycles for details about the carbon cycle). Carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases trap heat energy from the sun, resulting not only in an average increase in global temperature but also in changing precipitation patterns and increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes
        . Scientists overwhelmingly agree the present warming trend is caused by humans.</p>
        <p>Climate change is recognized as a major extinction threat, particularly when combined with other threats such as habitat loss. Scientists disagree about the likely magnitude of the effects, with extinction rate estimates ranging from 15 percent to 40 percent of species committed to extinction by 2050. By altering regional climates, it makes habitats less hospitable to the species living in them. While increased carbon dioxide levels can help plants conduct photosynthesis more efficiently, they are threatened by harsh temperatures and extreme weather events. Additionally, with warmer conditions, moisture from snow melt arrives earlier in the season, lengthening the fire season.</p>
        <p>The warming trend will shift colder climates toward the north and south poles. Climate gradients will also move up mountains, eventually crowding species higher in altitude and eliminating the habitat for those species adapted to the highest elevations. Some climates will completely disappear. In response to changing conditions, range shifts have also been observed in plants, butterflies, other insects, freshwater fishes, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals. Because individual plants cannot physically move to cooler regions, plant range shifts result from seed dispersal. Seeds are often dispersed in all directions away from a parent plant, but more of the seedlings that establish in northern locations or higher elevations survive, resulting in a gradual shift towards the poles or up mountains
          . However, species that cannot adapt to new conditions or shift their ranges quickly enough face extinction.</p>
          <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSmYY4YPtSHjc6CLAASfQkUxV7Nkk47dQbyRa0uO2kenedbiEttcht0Ah4EHKBGWiMga_4&usqp=CAU" alt="" class="climatechange">
          <p>Changing climates also throw off the delicate timing adaptations that species have to seasonal food resources and breeding times. Scientists have already documented many contemporary mismatches to shifts in resource availability and timing. For example, pollinating insects typically emerge in the spring based on temperature cues. In contrast, many plant species flower based on daylength cues. With warmer temperatures occurring earlier in the year, but daylength remaining the same, pollinators ahead of peak flowering. As a result, there is less food (nectar and pollen) available for the insects and less opportunity for plants to have their pollen dispersed.</p>
          <p>Ocean levels rise in response to climate change due to meltwater from glaciers and the greater volume occupied by warmer water. Shorelines will be inundated, reducing island size, which will have an effect on some species, and a number of islands will disappear entirely. Additionally, the gradual melting and subsequent refreezing of the poles, glaciers, and higher elevation mountains—a cycle that has provided freshwater to environments for centuries—will be altered. This could result in an overabundance of salt water and a shortage of fresh water.</p>
          <p>Finally, increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere react with ocean water to form carbonic acid, a phenomenon called ocean acidification. In combination with warmer temperatures, ocean acidification is responsible for coral bleaching, the process by which coral expel the algae that typically conduct photosynthesis within the corals. Ocean acidification can also dissolve the calcium carbonate skeletons formed by the coral. Overall, climate change plays a major role in the loss of nearly one third of coral reefs.</p>
          <p>The impacts of climate change extend to humans as well. Warmer temperatures will affect agricultural yield. In fact, a 2017 study by Zhao et al. found that for every degree Celsius increase in average global temperature, wheat yields are expected to decrease by 6%, rice yields by 3.2%, and maize by 7.4%. Additionally sea level rise and extreme weather events damage property and force people to move inland. Human health is directly impacted by heat-related illnesses and an expanding range of tropical diseases.</p>
        <h3>Deforestation</h3>
        <p>Deforestation is the removal of a forest or cluster of trees from land which is then converted to a non-forest use. Deforestation can involve conversion of forest land to farms, ranches, or urban use.</p>
        <p>The most concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests, which are particularly important to the world because they provide a habitat for millions of species of organisms, they regulate the world’s climate, they store nearly half of the world’s rainwater and they contain plants that are used in modern medications. Rain forests also absorb massive amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2).</p>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/post.medicalnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/iStock-149046398-1024x586.jpg?w=1155&h=2748" alt="" class="deforestation">
        <p>About 31% of Earth’s land surface is covered by forests. Deforestation can directly lead to biodiversity loss when animal species that live in the trees no longer have their habitat, cannot relocate, and therefore become extinct. Deforestation can lead certain tree species to permanently disappear, which affects biodiversity of plant species in an environment.</p>
        <p>Deforestation affects biodiversity in a number of ways. Trees may be removed from particular areas in order to make various wood products, to clear land for new buildings or roads, or for creating new farming or grazing land. It can also occur as a result of natural disasters or accidental fires.</p>
